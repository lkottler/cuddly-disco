# X-Team 61 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks

* After delineation of tasks, assignment will first be voluntary. 
* If there are more tasks to be assigned, Logan will use authoritative power to designate tasks.

## How we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks

* Group text message to post updates
* GitHub commits
* Group discussion over text and e-mail


## How we will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us

* Transparency of communication
* Use each other as resources for help
* All problems brought up in group text, or to Logan if preferred.

## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed

* Hold each other accountable.
* Transparency
* Keep the group up to date on how programs are going along via text or e-mail
